#### **How to claim Discord’s Reverence Pack without reinstalling Warframe**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do note: This does NOT work with the standalone launcher. BACKUP game files just in case something goes wrong. You do NOT need to install Warframe through Discord in order to obtain the Reverence pack. You DO need Discord Nitro \(not Nitro Classic\) for $10 in order to obtain the pack for free, otherwise it is $25. The Platinum obtained from the Reverence Pack is NOT tradeable.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To locate your game’s launcher location from Steam if you don’t have a standalone launcher, open your Steam Library and right click on Warframe. Click on Properties at the bottom and go to the `Local files` tab. `Click Browse local files…` and go to the `Tools` folder. The `Launcher.exe` file is the program we will be dealing with.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to wherever the Warframe **Launcher** is installed on your PC. As an example, my game is installed at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Warframe\Tools`
2. Right click `Launcher.exe` and click `Create Shortcut`
3. Right click on `Launcher.exe - Shortcut` and click `Properties` from the drop-down menu. [**Example Image**](https://i.imgur.com/5w8kHfu.jpg)\*\*\*\*
4.  ****First box on the Shortcut panel should be the Target box, and the path to the shortcut should be in quotation marks \(make sure to put one quotation mark on either end of the Target location if they are not already there\). At the very end, after the closing quotation mark, add a space and then the following: `-cluster:public -registry:Discord`[**Example Image**](https://i.imgur.com/eANAh83.jpg)
5. Click Apply, then OK, make sure the Discord Overlay is enabled inside Discord \(Options &gt; Overlay &gt; Enable in-game Overlay\) and that it is enabled to appear in Warframe, then run the shortcut. Log into the Warframe that opens and you should see the Reverence Pack right there on the main page of the in-game Market.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you tried these instructions and it did not work for you, PLEASE START FROM THE BEGINNING. It’s likely something wasn’t done correctly. Make sure you read CAREFULLY.
