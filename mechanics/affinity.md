### Tips for gaining affinity

There are multiple ways for gaining affinity to level your gear, 

* Grineer give the most affinity out of every faction, so it is recommended to run high level Grineer defense.
* Helene, Saturn - This place is great for affinity as well as passively farming Orokin Cells, because you need a lot to craft prime gear.
* Hydron, Sedna - Also a great area to farm affinity.
* Elite Sanctuary Onslaught - The best place to level up weapons, because it is a onslaught of high level enemies to grant tons of affinity.
* Adaro, Sedna - This place is a tricky one, It requires you to be stealthy, so it is recommended to bring someone with a Equinox and sleep everyone, because stealth kills stack up to 500% bonus affinity per kill, and like stated earlier, killing grants 50% to weapon and 50% to warframe.
