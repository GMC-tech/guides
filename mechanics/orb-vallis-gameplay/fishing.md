# Fishing

Orb Vallis features flowing coolant, acting like bodies of water similar to the Plains of Eidolon.  
Players can engage in spearfishing to catch various servofish, which can be used as resources to craft various Solaris United items, or can be gifted to The Business to increase standing with the Solaris United faction. You must acquire a Shockprod Fishing Spear from The Business in order to fish these servofish.

There are multiple different types of servofish,  
And those are,
