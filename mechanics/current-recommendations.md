# Current Baro Rotations

This will reset every time baro comes around.

#### UPDATED 5/31/2019

### Baro on PC:

* Primed Charged Shell - Very important for Radiation/Corrosive shotguns.
* Prisma Angstrum - Decent launcher secondary.
* Prisma Veritux - 3,000 mastery fodder for Archwings.
* Stalker Beacon - Buy this if you need stuff from the Stalker.
* Primed Banes - Slightly clunky but provides a large boost to non-shotgun primaries, especially on Gas/Slash procs, Buy if you can spare the Ducats and Endo to max them.

### Baro on Console:

* Primed Pressure Point - Super important for melee's, Get this first.
* Primed Heated Charge - High priority for radiation secondaries, a good 3rd elemental.
* Primed Cryo Rounds - Good for Hunter Munitions or Eidolon Chroma builds.
* Supra Vandal - Solid assault rifle.
* Machete Wraith -  3,000 mastery fodder for Melee's
* Stalker Beacon - Buy this if you need stuff from the Stalker.
