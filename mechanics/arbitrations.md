# Arbitrations

Arbitrations are a special alert that consist of elite versions of endless missions with special modifiers to help with the greater difficulty.

In order for a player to unlock these elite alerts, the player must complete every connected node in the star chart, Only nodes that do NOT need to be completed is Mutalist Alad V and Jordas Golem assassinations on Eris. \(The player can check their total progress by talking to the Arbitrations representative in the Arbiters of Hexis vendor in Relays.\)

Arbitrations will only select nodes with a endless mission type, these mission types consist of

* Survival
* Interception
* Defense
* Excavation
* Defection
* Infested Salvage

### Mechanic

In the Arbitration, Once you lose all of your health, you do NOT enter a bleedout phase, instead you die instantly, Once this occurs, a Revive Tower will appear at the place of death with a red way point. In order to use this Revive Tower, you must destroy Arbitration Shield Drones so they will drop Resurgence tokens, These tokens function identical to Index points so be careful, you need 5 of these to revive a dead player.

In the Arbitration, Arbitration Shield Drones will spawn with enemies, they function similarly to Shield Ospreys, but instead grant enemies immune to all types of damage and warframe abilities. You must kill these drones so the enemies will become vulnerable once again. Killing the drones will also explode on death, dealing high amounts of Blast damage to the ENEMY.

On your navigation, Before clicking on the Arbitration, you will notice a,
