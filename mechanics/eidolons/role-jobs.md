# Role Jobs

### Damage per second \(DPS\)

With the DPS role, There a few priorities.  
And those priorities being,

* Quickly knowing how to efficiently fast charge 1st lure.
* Able to produce Unairu Wisp in between energy spikes.
* Able to break a Synovia/Limb.
* Maintain your damage buff and combo counter \(Depends on the weapon for combo counter.\)
* Able to grab missing lures during Gantulyst/Hydrolyst heal phase if the Trinity fails.
* Help Trinity charge lures during Gantulyst/Hydrolyst

Here are more specifics to the above notes.

1. Fast charging is grabbing the first lure when you load into the Plains of Eidolon or when the Teralyst is spotted when you are in the Precharge run, Once you have hacked your lure, Fly over to the front of the gate and look for Vomvalyst to quickly charge the lure, Once you have charged the lure, fly over to the Teralyst and break the limb. \(Also note Trinity will drop you 2 lures, make sure to pick and charge those throughout the Teralyst fight.\)
2. Since you are supposed to run Unairu Wisp, You are required to be able to drop some Wisp for the people that are running Void Strike. When you get back from the Fast Charge, you can spawn wisp under the Teralyst. When the eidolon is down for Energy Spike, spam wisp before, through, and after energy spike. \(There are two spots where you can spawn Wisp, One of the methods is climbing up right knee and start spamming Wisp on the waist, Another method is walking up the left foot and spam E, Both methods will spawn Wisp under neath the eidolon.
3. Make sure that you have enough damage buff to effectively kill a limb.
4. If you are running a weapon that requires combo, shoot in between animations to maintain combo.
5. If the Trinity is short a lure, fly out and grab the missing amount of lures and return to the Eidolon.
6. When the eidolon enters healing phase, There will be Vomvalyst coming from different directions, or before he begins yelling, Vomvalyst will spawn under the eidolon, The uncharged lures can intercept and take those Vomvalyst and charge quicker.

### Trinity

With the Trinity role, There a few priorities.  
And those priorities being,

* Able to make sure Lures don't die by casting Bless \(4th\) at  reasonable times.
* Able to quickly hack a bunch of lures, As Trinity, You will hack 2 lures, Drop them to the DPS, Then fly out to grab 5 more Lures, If the spawns fail and end up one short, that is fine, because the DPS can get the missing lure.
* Able to contribute reasonable shield damage since you are running Void Strike.

Here are more specifics to the above notes.

1. Since you have a ability that instantly heals, and grants a bonus of 75% damage resistance for a good amount of time, you're second duty is to make sure the lures and your teammates do not die, it can cause some issues if they die.
2. Since ciphers work on lures, you can quickly hack a lure while in archwing and itzal blink to other lure spawns to quickly grab more at a quick pace.
3. Since you are running Void Strike, you should be able to down shields with Harrow and Volt at a good pace.

### Harrow

With the Harrow role, There a few priorities.  
And those priorities being,

* Casting your 4th on time with Energy Spike and Healing Phase.
* Contribute reasonable shield damage since you are running Void Strike.

A note to go with the first bullet point.

1. Since you are running 92-95% duration, you want to cast your 4th right as Energy Spike starts or when the Eidolon tips his head down even further to do the initial Energy Spike.

### Volt

With the Volt role, There a few priorities.  
And those priorities being,

* Cast shields at a angle, allowing maximal amp bonus damage.
* Have good shield setups.
* Able to preshield if asked.
* Main backup as the DPS if the DPS messes up.
* Help find Vomvalyst if the DPS/Trinity is having issues.
* Contribute reasonable shield damage since you are running Void Strike.

Here are more specifics to the above notes.

1. You want to be placing shields at his right leg facing upwards, so you can shoot up the leg and hit multiple hitboxes, and through the shields it will deal serious amounts of damage.
2. Preshielding is placing the volt shields at future Gantulyst/Hydrolyst spawns while the eidolon is beginning to stand up, but before going to preshield, you might wanna place a few shields for the DPS to quickly capshot.
3. Volt is a viable DPS option because he has the ability to place his shields anywhere he wants, If the DPS messes up something like slow limb, or fast charge, the volt can take over and kill a limb.
