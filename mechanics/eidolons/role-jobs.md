# Role Jobs

### Damage per second \(DPS\)

As the damage role, it is actually pretty simple once you get the hang of it.

First thing is first, fast charging. What fast charging basically is, is grabbing the first lure out of your squad when you load into the plains or in pre-charge run, once you spot the Eidolon column coming out of the water, fly out to go grab a lure from either Twin Horns, or the small Grineer camp to the East, then quickly blinking over with Itzal to the front of the gate where a couple of Vomvalyst will spawn, Damage these Vomvalyst into Energy Form, then let the lure consume them until the lure is charged, then once charged, fly over to the Teralyst and break first limb. \(Also while on topic of Lures, Trinity will grab 2 lures for you, pick these up, charge them, use the extra lure for quickly speeding through the Gantulyst, also your duty will now be to teleport the loot over to the shrine, this is pretty simple, as soon as cap shot ding, blink over to the shrine and the lures will teleport.\)

Second thing, Unairu Wisp, Since you are NOT running Void Strike, your other duty is top drop Wisp for the people actually using Void Strike, When you kill a limb, \(There are 2 methods to spawn in wisp.\) Climb up the right knee and spam wisp on the waist, or alternatively depending on the Eidolons position, walk up the left toe and spam wisp.

Third thing, actually killing a limb, this is really simple, get out your weapon used to self damage, rather it may be Cerata, Glaive Prime, or even Hikou Prime, buff up your Vex Armor to maximum potential, and shoot the limbs with your damage weapon.

### Trinity

As the Trinity role, this can get pretty stressful due to bugs and what not.

First thing is first, getting lures. There is a lure following map in the section "Other Guides", follow this route for lure grabbing, Also make sure to have a lot of Ciphers within your Gear Wheel, Because Ciphers are very very very very good for hunting, it's just a simple tap of your Y key and it auto hacks the lure.

Second thing, Shields. Someone in the squad during pre-charge run will say something on the lines of "trin how many shields?", Since you are charging up void strike as well, you will take out either 1,2,3,4 Teralyst shields, When you take out a shield, grab 1 lure, When you take out another shield, grab another lure, then drop those 2 lures to the DPS, After you have taken out the shields you specified, grab your 5 lures and return to the Eidolon.

Third thing, Blessing. Cast your bless every so often, so your lures will stay alive.

### Harrow

As the Harrow role, this is pretty simple once you get the hang of it.

First thing is first, Covenant. You just have to cast you 4th ability before every Energy Spike to keep your time alive and negate the Magnetic procs, Also cast it while the Eidolon is beginning to stand up from Healing Phase to give the DPS more damage output. 

### Volt

As the Volt role, this is a pretty stressful role, but simple once you get used to it.

First thing is first, Providing Shields. The main duty of Volt is to provide Shields for the Void Strike users to shoot through, this gives a 200% critical damage buff.

Second thing, Placement. You want to be placing your shields on the eidolons left \(Your right\) heel facing upwards, so that way people using the Shraksun can shoot upwards and deal more damage, making it easier to one shot shields. After all the limbs are broken and getting ready to cap-shot, Place 3 shields facing the eidolons head and cast 1 on them to make them more visible for the DPS.

Third thing, Pre-shield. While the Eidolon is beginning to stand up, Fly over to the future Gantulyst or Hydrolyst spawn locations in front of the Shrine, and begin placing shields.
