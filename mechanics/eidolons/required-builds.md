# Required Builds



Here are some of the builds that can suffice in any scenario during eidolon hunts.

### Chroma

Here is the Chroma build that can suffice in Eidolon hunts,  
A few notes to go with the following build.

* Must build for over 280% Power Strength to have high enough Fury to one-two shot.
* Must build for very high Duration for two reasons, Vex Armor and Elemental Ward - Elemental Ward, You should be running Toxin Ward for the Reload Speed to build combo faster, the additional Reload Speed from Toxin Ward is scaled off of Duration. - Vex Armor, You want your Vex Armor to last a good amount of time without worrying to recast 24/7
* Streamline is placed here so you don't burn up 2 pads for 1 Vex Armor cast, helps for pad saving.
* Range isn't needed here because other people do not need your buff, so negative range is fine.
* Handspring for Exilus because the faster knockdown recovery is great QoL.
* Corrosive Projection is a place holder here, only use if you there are less then 3 present in the squad. - Other options are Enemy Radar, or Sniper Scavenger. Dead Eye is you are too lazy to forma the Aura.
* Arcane Nullifier is a place holder here, you can use these if you wish, - Arcane Acceleration and Arcane Momentum are other viable options, - Arcane Avenger for cases where you need the critical chance boost.
