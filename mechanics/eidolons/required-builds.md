# Required Builds

Here are some of the builds that can suffice in any scenario during eidolon hunts.

### Chroma

Here is the build that is suitable for Chroma Prime, Here some notes to go along with the following build.

You want to build above 280% Power Strength so you can get your Vex Armor's damage buff high enough to be able to one-two shot a Eidolon limb/capshot. You want very high duration so that way Vex Armor will last a good amount of time and because your Elemental Ward's \(Assuming you're running Toxin ward, because it's highly recommended, because it boost reload speed to provide faster combo building.\) Reload buff, because it is more effective with more duration. Streamline is placed here so you don't spend 2 energy pads for 1 Vex Armor buff, Range should be the least of your concerns, because YOU are the damage dealer.

Swap out Corrosive Projection for either Enemy Radar or Sniper Scavenger if the other members in your party is already running a total of 3 Corrosive Projections, because reminder you DON'T want full armor strip, only 90-99%.

### Volt

Here is the build that is suitable for Volt Prime, Here some notes to go along with the following build.

The most important thing here is the very high Duration, because you want to be able to keep shields up for a long time, this allows you to be able to reliably pre-shield, right after Duration is the Efficiency, because you want to be able to cast your shields at a good pace without worrying about running out of energy. Range is not important here because shield's are not affected by range, nor strength.

Swap out Coaction Drift if the other members in your party is already running a total of 2 Coaction Drifts, because reminder you DON'T want full armor strip, only 90-99%.

### Trinity

Here is the build that is suitable for Trinity Prime, Here some notes to go along with the following build.

The most important thing here is the 150% power strength, what this does is cap out the maximum damage resistance you receive from Bless \(Which is 75%\), Right after that is the Duration, because after all you want Bless to last a while so your lures won't die. Efficiency is also good here because after all, it is your 4th ability which can drain a lot, so this means you will use less pads, Range is not needed here because bless scales off of affinity range. \(Use a rank 3 Fleeting Expertise because gaining 5% efficiency over the loss of 10% duration is not worth the trade.\)

Swap out Coaction Drift if the other members in your party is already running a total of 2 Coaction Drifts, because reminder you DON'T want full armor strip, only 90-99%.

### Harrow

Here is the build that is suitable for Harrow, Here some notes to go along with the following build.

The absolute most important thing here is the specific amount of Duration, That duration usually is 92-95% duration, mainly because you want to it to last through Energy Spike and for the Retaliation crit buff to run out before the next Energy Spike. Efficiency is good here so you can reliable cast 4th every single Energy Spike, Strength so you can build up the Retaliation faster for the cap-shot. Range is not needed because it does not affect Covenant. 

Swap out Coaction Drift if the other members in your party is already running a total of 2 Coaction Drifts, because reminder you DON'T want full armor strip, only 90-99%.

### Rubico/Prime

The Rubico build is pretty simple, Since the Eidolons are status immune, you want to use 90% elementals, Which is Hellfire and Stormbringer to make Radiation DAMAGE, since the Eidolons also have Alloy Armor which takes 75% more damage from Radiation. After that you want to slot in Vital Sense and Point Strike to increase your critical chance and damage, Then you slot in Split Chamber and Vigilante Armaments for the Multishot, Then there is the flex slot, This slot can be slotted in with Vile Acceleration for faster combo building, a Riven Mod, or even Argon Scope.

Now lets talk about why there is no Serration, Vex Armor is additive with damage mods such as Serration/Heavy Caliber, Basically it's one big serration and acts like a 9th mod slot, Primed Cryo Rounds wins this slot because it's a huge cold damage boost, which deals 25% damage to alloy armor. Also because elementals scale better. The math for it is,

\(1 + 8.88\)\(1 + \(1.75x1.25\)\(0.9+0.9\)+ 1.25\(1.65\)\) = 69.16 \| Primed Cryo Rounds

\(1 + 8.88 + 1.65\)\(1 + \(1.75x1.25\)\(0.9+0.9\)\) = 56.929375 \| Serration

If you are running anything other then Chroma, Slot in Serration then.

### Lanka

Follows the same as Rubico.

### Titania

 Here is the build that is suitable for Titania, Here some notes to go along with the following build.

The most important thing here is the high strength, because it gives Dex Pixia a damage multiplier, This build also follows near neutral Duration and Efficiency, this is because it helps to maintain your 4th. Range is not needed here because your 4th doesn't need it, it will waste potential. Arcane Velocity is a near must here because it will give Dex Pixia much more fire rate, which will seriously improve your efficiency in hunting.

Following up with the Dex Pixia build, Again since the Eidolon is status immune, you want to use 90% elementals, such as Convulsion, and in this case, Primed/Normal Heated Charge to stack Radiation DAMAGE, since again it deals 75% extra damage to Alloy Armor, Lethal Torrent and Barrel Diffusion to stack up on Multishot, Hornet Strike and Magnum Force to stack up on Damage, and Primed Target Cracker and Primed Pistol Gambit to stack up on Crit.

### Ivara

Here is the build that is suitable for Ivara, Here some notes to go along with the following build.

The main important thing here is the very high Strength, because without Strength you won't get a very high multiplier on your Navigator ability. Efficiency helps to be able maintain energy while Navigator is active, because it will drain a lot of energy over time. Duration and Range is not needed here, Empowered Quiver is a flex slot, Use this augment if you want the additional critical damage buff, but want to be more squishy, use Adaptation if you are want to die less, but at the cost of more damage output, Very important to put on 2 Arcane Guardians, because again, Ivara is insanely squishy.

Following up with the Sancti Castanas build, Again since the Eidolon is status immune, you want to use 90% elementals, such as Convulsion, and in this case, Primed/Normal Heated Charge to stack Radiation DAMAGE, since again it deals 75% extra damage to Alloy Armor, Hornet Strike and Magnum Force to stack up on Damage, Primed Target Cracker and Hollow Point and Primed Pistol Gambit to stack on as much Crit as possible, Riven mod is kind of needed because of super high disposition, Multishot is not needed here because Navigator does NOT pick up on Multishot.
