# Required Builds

## Tips/Arcanes

### Gaining Combo

Gaining Combo for your Sniper/Melee is pretty simple, all you do is shoot the Eidolon at any given time to increase your Combo Counter, do note that this Combo Counter will decay over time, so you wanna keep shooting, hence why Carrier is good for Eidolons since it can supply Ammo when needed.

### Used Arcanes

The usage of Arcanes can play a huge part during the Eidolon fights, that being said, lets dive in. Every role besides the DPS should use Arcane Nullifier since they have no reason to use other Arcanes, and because Nullifier helps with blocking magnetic procs from everything.

The DPS's Arcanes are dependent on what weapon they choose to run, If it is a Primary, they should run Arcane Acceleration and Arcane Momentum, if they are running a Melee, they should run Arcane Strike and Arcane Avenger.
