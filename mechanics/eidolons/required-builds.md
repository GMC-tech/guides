### Rubico/Prime

Here is the Rubico build that can suffice in Eidolon hunts,  
A few notes to go with the following build.

* Mandatory to have Radiation damage because it deals 75% extra damage to Alloy Armor.
* Mandatory to have Multishot to add more pellets to your shots.
* Mandatory to have Vital Sense and Point Strike to enhance your Critical Chance & Damage.
* Flex Slot, Currently there is Vile Acceleration in the Flex Slot, because it increases Quality of Life.
* Riven Mod, Argon Scope, Vile Acceleration are viable options for the spot.
* Primed Cryo Rounds is slotted over Serration because with CHROMA, All types of +damage are additive with Vex Armor, If you do NOT have Primed Cryo Rounds, slot in Wildfire. 
* For evidence that PCR deals more damage, here is the math. \(1 + 8.88\)\(1 + \(1.75x1.25\)\(0.9+0.9\)+ 1.25\(1.65\)\) = 69.16 \| Primed Cryo Rounds \(1 + 8.88 + 1.65\)\(1 + \(1.75x1.25\)\(0.9+0.9\)\) = 56.929375 \| Serration
* If you are running anything else, Serration is fine then.
