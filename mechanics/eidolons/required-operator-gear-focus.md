# Required Operator Gear/Focus

Here is the most vital part in a hunt, because with out a operator you cannot do a eidolon hunt, because like stated earlier, you need a operator to deplete the eidolons shields.

### Amp

So first thing is first, let me explain what a Amp is, The Amp is basically a weapon that goes on your Operator after you have completed The War Within and have spoken to Quill Onkko for the first time at  Cetus. This Amp is much better then your Operator's Chest Beam after The Second Dream and no Amp at all straight after The War Within, When you first speak to Onkko, you will receive your very own Mote Amp, This is a pretty basic amp, but you are NOT ready to do a casual tridolon just yet, With this amp you should kill some Teralyst for standing, rank up within Onkko so you can unlock different parts of Amp combinations, At the rank of Mote \(Which is rank 1\), You should buy the parts, Raplak Prism, Pencha Scaffold, Clapkra Brace, This results in a 1-1-1 Amp, Which is much better then the Mote Amp, And with this you can kill a Tridolon much more efficiently. After you have gathered a lot more standing from a few Tridolons, Rank up further to hit the rank of Adherent \(Which is rank 3\), Now you should of unlocked the best amp possible till you can unlock Vox Solaris standing, Which is a X-2-3\(Prism, Shraksun Scaffold, Lohrin Brace\), X means you can use anything here, because you want the alternate fire \(Which is the Scaffold\) for Eidolon hunts. After you have ranked up with Vox Solaris to the rank of Instrument \(Which is rank 4\), You now have unlocked the best Brace for Eidolon hunts, which is the Certus Brace, Now you can make a X-2-7 \(Prism, Shraksun Scaffold, Certus Brace\). You might wonder why Shraksun over any other Scaffold, This is because Shraksun shoots a flak that can travel up the Eidolons leg which can hit multiple hit boxes, and then do the initial explosion, this results in serious damage, often one shotting with Void Strike stacks.

### Focus

So lets get started with what else you need on your operator, Use this route if you are not playing the damage role.

1. Madurai &gt; Phoenix Talons UNLOCK 
2. Madurai &gt; Void Radiance UNLOCK \(Do not level\) 
3. Madurai &gt; Void Strike MAX 
4. Zenurik &gt; Energy Pulse UNLOCK 
5. Zenurik &gt; Void Siphon UNLOCK
6. Zenurik &gt; Void Flow UNBOUND
7. Naramon &gt; Affinity Spike UNLOCK
8. Naramon &gt; Mind Step UNLOCK
9. Naramon &gt; Mind Sprint UNBOUND
10. Zenurik &gt; Void Siphon UNBOUND
11. Vazarin &gt; Mending Unity UNLOCK
12. Vazarin &gt; Enduring Tides UNBOUND
13. Madurai &gt; Inner Gaze UNBOUND 
14. Unairu  &gt; Void Spines UNLOCK
15. Unairu  &gt; Basilisk Scales UNBOUND
16. Madurai &gt; Eternal Gaze UNBOUND 
17. Vazarin &gt; Rejuvenating Tides UNBOUND
18. Naramon &gt; Mind Step UNBOUND

Void Strike is the most important here, what it does is the longer you sit in void mode, the more damage you do for the next 8 shots, and gathering enough damage will result you in one shotting the eidolons shields, amazing right? Use this route if you are playing the damage role.

1. Unairu &gt; Void Spines UNLOCK 
2. Unairu &gt; Magnetic Blast UNLOCK 
3. Unairu &gt; Unairu Wisp MAX 
4. Zenurik &gt; Energy Pulse UNLOCK 
5. Zenurik &gt; Void Siphon UNLOCK
6. Zenurik &gt; Void Flow UNBOUND
7. Naramon &gt; Affinity Spike UNLOCK
8. Naramon &gt; Mind Step UNLOCK
9. Naramon &gt; Mind Sprint UNBOUND
10. Zenurik &gt; Void Siphon UNBOUND
11. Vazarin &gt; Mending Unity UNLOCK
12. Vazarin &gt; Enduring Tides UNBOUND
13. Madurai &gt; Inner Gaze UNBOUND 
14. Unairu  &gt; Basilisk Scales UNBOUND
15. Madurai &gt; Eternal Gaze UNBOUND 
16. Vazarin &gt; Rejuvenating Tides UNBOUND
17. Naramon &gt; Mind Step UNBOUND

Unairu Wisp is the most important here, what it does is when you perform a void blast, it has a 100% chance to summon a tiny wisp, when the wisp is picked up by either you or your teammates, your operator damage is increased by 100% for 12 seconds, very amazing to pair with Void Strike users.

### Arcanes

Operator arcanes play a huge part in terms of effectiveness. Some of the most important ones would be Magus Vigor, Magus Elevate, Magus Anomaly, Magus Repair, Virtuous Shadow.

* Magus Vigor - Increases operator health by 200.
* Magus Elevate - Entering Warframe has a 75% chance to heal it for 200 health.
* Magus Anomaly - Entering Warframe will cause enemies in 20 meters to be pulled to the warframe.
* Magus Repair - In Void Mode, It will heal warframes in a 20 meter radius by 20% health per second.
* Virtuous Shadow - On headshots, 40% Chance for a multiplicative 60% critical chance boost.
