# Required Operator Gear/Focus

Here is the most vital part in a hunt, because with out a operator you cannot do a eidolon hunt, because like stated earlier, you need a operator to deplete the eidolons shields.

### Amp

After you have completed The War Within and Saya's Vigil, You are now able to head on over to Quill Onkko to speak to him to receive your very own Mote Amp. Note that this amp is NOT good for a Hydrolyst, but you sure can do a few Teralyst with it to gain more standing, you want to swap out this amp as soon as possible.

### 1-1-1 Amp

After you have done a few Teralyst with your Mote Amp, you should have gathered enough Sentient Cores to convert into standing to make a 1-1-1 amp, To be more specific, This amp consist of Raplak Prism, Pencha Scaffold, Clapkra Brace. This amp is 100x better then the Mote Amp and will help you out through a Hydrolyst fight.

### X-2-3 Amp

After you have done a few Tridolons with your improved 1-1-1 amp, You should have gathered enough sentient cores to progress through Quill standing to make a X-2-3, To be more specific, X means any prism since the alt fire is what you use for Eidolons, Shraksun Scaffold because it is the best scaffold in hunts, Lohrin Brace because you want as much critical chance as you can get in eidolon fights. This amp will serve you well in any scenario, it can even do the most competitive, 6x3.

### X-2-7 Amp

Now comes the best amp into play, After you have gotten through the ranks of Vox Solaris and are able to get the Certus Brace, The best amp is a X-2-7, What is different from the X-2-3 and the X-2-7 is the 8% critical chance between the Lohrin and Certus Brace. This amp will surely last in every scenario.

### X-7-7 Amp

Here comes the amp that is surely different then the X-2-7, Instead of using the Shraksun Scaffold, you replace it with the Propa Scaffold, which fires a ball that travels up to 2 meters, which explodes on contact or it will automatically explode after 3 seconds of flight, This amp requires more coordination to suffice in a 4x3/5x3/6x3. Unless you instantly detonate it, you have to time it properly to detonate as soon as shields go up.

### Focus

So lets get started with what else you need on your operator focus trees.

### Void Strike

Void Strike is the most important here, what it does is the longer you sit in void mode, the more damage you do for the next 8 shots, and gathering enough damage will result you in one shotting the eidolons shields, amazing right? 

1. Madurai &gt; Phoenix Talons UNLOCK 
2. Madurai &gt; Void Radiance UNLOCK \(Do not level\) 
3. Madurai &gt; Void Strike MAX 
4. Zenurik &gt; Energy Pulse UNLOCK 
5. Zenurik &gt; Void Siphon UNLOCK

### Unairu Wisp

Unairu Wisp is the most important here, what it does is when you perform a void blast, it has a 100% chance to summon a tiny wisp, when the wisp is picked up by either you or your teammates, your operator damage is increased by 100% for 12 seconds, very amazing to pair with Void Strike users.
