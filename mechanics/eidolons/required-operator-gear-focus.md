# Required Operator Gear/Focus

##  Meta Operator Amps

Amps are modular weapons that enhance your Operators combat capabilities,   
Since these items are modular, this section will cover what combinations are best for Eidolons.

People will often refer the best amp to be "x23, x27, or x77"  
They are referring to the parts listed above, So what would mean:  
x-2-3 = Any Prism, Shraksun Scaffold, Lohrin Brace  
x-2-7 = Any Prism, Shraksun Scaffold, Certus Brace  
x-7-7= Any Prism, Propa Scaffold, Certus Brace

Disclaimer:  
If you are just starting out and still are on the Mote Amp,  
It would be strongly recommended to kill a few Teralyst, Use the cores gathered and make a 1-1-1 Amp,  
Which is a Raplak Prism, Pencha Scaffold, Clapkra Brace.   
This amp will serve much better then a Mote Amp in a Tridolon hunt. 

## Meta Operator Focus

### Void Strike

On leaving Void Mode the next **1 / 1 / 2 / 4 / 6 / 8** attacks deal **5% / 7% / 8% / 10% / 11% / 12%** additional damage for every second spent cloaked. Cloak consumes **2** additional energy per second.

* The charges created by Void Strike will be consumed if either the Operator or the Warframe performs an attack.
* Cloaking again while having charges left will increase the damage bonus for the remaining charges, but new charges will not be stored until all are used.

### Unairu Wisp

Void Blast has a **25% / 50% / 75% / 100%** chance to summon a Wisp when it damages an enemy. The Wisp can be picked up by allies to increase Operator damage by **20% / 40% / 60% / 100%** for**3 / 6 / 9 / 12** seconds.

* The Unairu Wisp shares the same model as [Cetus Wisp](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Cetus_Wisp) and is most often found laying on the ground.
* Multiple wisps can be picked up by a single Operator, refreshing their duration.
* The wisp grants a multiplicative damage bonus
