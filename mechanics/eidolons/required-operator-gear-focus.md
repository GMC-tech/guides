# Required Operator Gear/Focus

Here is the most vital part in a hunt, because with out a operator you cannot do a eidolon hunt, because like stated earlier, you need a operator to deplete the eidolons shields.

### Amp

After you have completed The War Within and Saya's Vigil, You are now able to head on over to Quill Onkko to speak to him to receive your very own Mote Amp. Note that this amp is NOT good for a Hydrolyst, but you sure do a few Teralyst with it to gain more standing, you want to swap out this amp as soon as possible.

### 1-1-1 Amp

After you have done a few Teralyst with your Mote Amp, you should have gathered enough Sentient Cores to convert into standing to make a 1-1-1 amp, To be more specific, This amp consist of Raplak Prism, Pencha Scaffold, Clapkra Brace. This amp is 100x better then the Mote Amp and will help you out through a Hydrolyst fight.

### X-2-3 Amp

After you have done a few Tridolons with your improved 1-1-1 amp, You should have gathered enough sentient cores to progress through Quill standing to make a X-2-3, To be more specific, X means any prism since alt fire is what you use for Eidolons, Shraksun Scaffold because it is the best scaffold in hunts, Lohrin Brace because you want as much critical chance as you can get in eidolon fights. This amp will serve you well in any scenario, it can even do the most competitive, 6x3.

Void Strike is the most important here, what it does is the longer you sit in void mode, the more damage you do for the next 8 shots, and gathering enough damage will result you in one shotting the eidolons shields, amazing right? Use this route if you are playing the damage role.
